# Knowledge & Tools Page — Implementation Plan

## Goal
Update the **Knowledge & Tools** page to align with the new design system (Primary Blue: `#55b7e0`, Warning Orange: `#fab728`) and improve functionality.

## Proposed Changes

### [MODIFY] [KnowledgeBase.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Daniel%20Roldan%20CT/Desktop/Innagent%20%20CustomerAGI%20Proyect/Innagent/pages/KnowledgeBase.tsx)

#### UI/UX Updates
- **Color Palette**: Replace primary blue with `#55b7e0` and warning states with `#fab728`.
- **Status Badges**: Use slate grays for "Indexed", "Active", "Resolved" badges to maintain a professional SaaS aesthetic.
- **Removals**: Delete the `.mp4` video knowledge source as per the revised structure.
- **Tab System**:
  - Implement a state-based tab switcher between `📄 Knowledge Base` and `🧩 Tools & API`.
  - When `Knowledge Base` is selected, show the "Data Sources" grid.
  - When `Tools & API` is selected, show the "Tools & Extensions" table.

#### Data Sources Section
- **PDF Card**: Styled with refined typography and the new status badge.
- **Web Card**: Includes the spinning "Updating..." indicator with warning color `#fab728`.
- **Hover States**: Cards should have a subtle shadow lift and title color shift on hover.

#### Tools & Extensions Section
- **Table Styling**: Clean table with hover states and a functional "Config" button that navigates to `/tools/1`.
- **"Connect Tool" Button**: Styled as a primary CTA.

#### Floating Status Widget
- Update colors and positioning to match the Dashboard's aesthetics.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Check for accessibility (aria-labels).
- Verify navigation via "Config" button.

### Manual Verification
- Test tab switching.
- Verify dark/light mode transition on cards.
- Check "No AI Connected yet" indicators (if applicable).
